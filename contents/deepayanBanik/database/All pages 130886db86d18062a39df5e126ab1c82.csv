Stars,Research,,"Differential rotation and meridional circulation in stellar interiors are often neglected in evolutionary models that treat stars as rigidly-rotating one dimensional objects. However, in reality they highly three dimensional with complex fluid motion that not only affect the current state of stars but also their past and future. I work on this using theoretical and computational fluid dynamics."
Planets,Research,,Exoplanetary climate physics is focused on using a variety of tools. I use shallow water models of planetary atmospheres to study variably irradiated synchronous and asynchronous planets.  I also collaborate on using high resolution phase resolved spectroscopy to probe ultra hot Jupiters for magnetic fields.
Asteroids,Research,,"In the past, I have studied the spin and shape evolution of rubble-pile asteroids using discrete and continuum methods for granular flows with focus on top-shaped asteroids like Bennu and Ryugu. Current collaborative work extends into developing a comprehensive asteroid evolution history package for population statistics."
Miscellaneous,Research,,"Some of my old work dealt with the theoretical design of mechanical logic gates like the OR gate, using compliant bistable arches and their macroscale prototyping as a proof of concept for eventual miniaturization. I have also worked on designing tests for LLM evaluation in the field of physics."
